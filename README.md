Taking tiny steps towards faith and science
Nature is physical we see God revealing himself in nature by animals giving birth. Showing that only God ca create life.  How this is so the bible say God was the first born from the dead.
Through the bible, the word of God was preached to all creation.  If you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.  In footnote it states that this is preaching is the whole world meaning the then Rome Empire and refering to human.  However I am of the opinion that when the gospel is preach to individual the whole world it affect everthing living and not living.  The example I give, is the recent stay at home by humans.  There is reports that the environment has benefited by the reduction of human activity that is carbon emission.  So when the gospel is preach to the whole world it is preached to living and non living things.


How do I feel about the universe seeming like it has no boundary and seeming like it has no need for me in it. Well I feel insignificant
yet I feel significant knowing that the heavenly father has created the everything. Both on heaven and earth and hath given human dominion over all living things.
I read that gravitational waves are formed by massive object colliding e.g. two blackholes.  This gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space time.  With space and time being one thing that is spacetime.  This means before the big bang theory there was nothing of space time because there was not any mass and gravitational waves.
The Anthropic  principle this is : The cosmological principle that theories of the universe are constrained by the necessity to allow human existence.  The Anthropic principle is the philosophical premise that any dat we collect about the universe is filtered by the bact that, in order for it to be obserable in the first place, it must be compatible wit the emergence of conscious and sapient life that obseves it.

Oh excellent is thy name, O lord our lord that the Psalmist emphasize that the lord he serves is not only his  lord but others.  This made him feel not alone to have the lord as his lord. Thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.  Meaning God has given man dominion over the stars an the moon he created.

He discribes this relationship betwween God and humans by saying.  "Thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands, meaning God's relationship is like an owner of property giving authority to a servant to take care of his property and possessions.

In relationship to creatures he as given man dominion over them.  

Repetitive he repeats . "O lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth", to forcefully emphazise this about our lord.

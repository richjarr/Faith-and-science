Taking tiny steps towards faith and science
Nature is physical we see God revealing himself in nature by animals giving birth. Showing that only God ca create life.  How this is so the bible say God was the first born from the dead.
Through the bible, the word of God was preached to all creation.  If you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.  In footnote it states that this is preaching is the whole world meaning the then Rome Empire and refering to human.  However I am of the opinion that when the gospel is preach to individual the whole world it affect everthing living and not living.  The example I give, is the recent stay at home by humans.  There is reports that the environment has benefited by the reduction of human activity that is carbon emission.  So when the gospel is preach to the whole world it is preached to living and non living things.
How do I feel about the universe seeming like it has no boundary and seeming like it has no need for me in it. Well I feel insignificant
yet I feel significant knowing that the heavenly father has created the everything. Both on heaven and earth and hath given human dominion over all living things.

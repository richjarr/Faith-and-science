# Faith-and-science
Taking tiny steps towards faith and science
nature is physical and we see God revealing himself in nature by animals giving birth. Showing that only God can create life in the whole sense.  In the sense of the of concept of being fruitful and the multipling of individuals.  How this is so the bible say Jesus was the first born from the dead.
Through the bible, the word of God was preached to all creation.  If you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.  In the footnote it states that this is preaching is to the whole world meaning, the then Rome Empire and refering to all human beings.  However I am of the opinion that when the gospel is preach to individuals, the whole world is affected, everthing living and not living.  The example I give, is the recent stay at home or shelter in place.  There is reports that the environment has benefited by the reduction of human activity and a reduction in carbon emission.  So when the gospel is preach to the whole world it is preached to living and non living things.


How do I feel about the universe seeming like it has no boundary and seeming like it has no need for me in it. Well I feel insignificant
yet I feel significant knowing that the heavenly father has created the everything. Both on heaven and earth and hath given human dominion over all living things.
I read that gravitational waves are formed by massive object colliding e.g. two blackholes.  This gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space time.  With space and time being one thing that is spacetime.  This means before the big bang theory there was nothing of space time because there was not any mass and gravitational waves.
The Anthropic principle this is : The cosmological principle that theories of the universe are constrained by the necessity to allow human existence.  The Anthropic principle is the philosophical premise that any data we collect about the universe is filtered by the bact that, in order for it to be observable in the first place, it must be compatible with the emergence of conscious and sapient life that observes it.

Oh excellent is thy name, O lord our lord that the Psalmist emphasize that the lord he serves is not only his  lord but others.  This made him feel not alone to have the lord as his lord. Thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.  Meaning God has given man dominion over the stars an the moon he created.

He discribes this relationship betwween God and humans by saying.  "Thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands, meaning God's relationship is like an owner of property giving authority to a servant to take care of his property and possessions.

In relationship to creatures he as given man dominion over them.  

Repetitively he repeats . "O lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth", to forcefully emphazise the diviness about our lord.

Why is it difficult for people of faith to accept or trust scientific theories.  It is hard for christians to accept scientific theories, because the way they are taught.  Some Christians are sometimes isolated from the world every day activities and taught to trust in God and have little to do with every day world are taught to, mistrust scientific theories because they can not be explained with God behid these scientific theories.

Why are people of faith challenged by scientific facts when they are not trouble by facts the bible teaches.  The teching of the bible emphasis that one should have teaching that to be saved we must believe that Jesus is the son of God.  The Christians are troubled when it comes to scientific facts because it does not have God's presents in the theories, like the big bang, where the world creation and the creation of matter.  With this theory they are taken aback when the lord is not mentioned for they are taught that God created the world in 7 (seven) days.  This is a contradiction to what the Christian is taught.

Why is there such a great gap between faith and reason?  Can rational people also be people of faith, The teaching and the isolation of individuals cause the great gap between faith and scientific reasoning.  I think that rational scientific people can be people of faith.  If they believe in the teachings of the bible and set out the solve problems by scientific theories.
